# veevart-knapSack
A Veevart logic test solution where you can input a list of items and a weight capacity of the knapsack and the Solution will log the items list combination with the more accumulable value without overpassing the given capacity.

You can open in the browser the [codepen](https://codepen.io/anzaiagithub/pen/ZEMgRGW?editors=0011) and open the console window to see the results.

You can also make your own calls to the solution function with the (listOfItems,weightCapacity) arguments to see the results like the next example:
```JAVASCRIPT
const listOfItems = [
    [item0.weigth , item0.value],
    [item1.weigth , item1.value],
    [item2.weigth , item2.value],
    ...,
    [itemN.weigth , itemN.value],
];
const capacity = 10;

solution(listOfItems,capacity);
```
then, check in the console for your solution output.
